# Jyazo C#
This application is a complete rewrite for the client side of
the following [project](https://github.com/sabihismail/Jyazo-Screenshot)
completed quickly in under a day.

I have migrated the client to C# because of the problems I was facing
with Java's limited functionality and the annoyance of dealing with
Swing on JavaFX. Knowing I would be targetting Windows for the most part, 
I've decided that this will be the client from here onwards.

The server and the old Java client will still be visible on the above
linked project. There are no comments on this project but functions
are very similar so comments from the previous project would still
apply.

Gfycat is no longer being used as this new GIFWriter class allows
for a more optimized and reliable GIF creation as opposed to the
inconsistency I was facing in Java.
